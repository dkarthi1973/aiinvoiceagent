mkdir -p /opt/ai-invoice-agent
cd /opt/ai-invoice-agent

# Clone the repository (if using version control)
git clone <repository-url> .

# Or extract from provided archive
tar -xzf ai-invoice-agent.tar.gz
```

Verify that Python 3.11 or higher is installed and accessible:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If Python 3.11 is not available, install it using your system's package manager or download from the official Python website. For Ubuntu/Debian systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-pip python3.11-venv
```

### Step 2: Virtual Environment Setup

Creating an isolated Python virtual environment ensures dependency isolation and prevents conflicts with system-wide packages. This approach is particularly important for production deployments where multiple Python applications may coexist.

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip to latest version
pip install --upgrade pip
```

For Windows environments, the activation command differs:

```cmd
# Windows Command Prompt
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### Step 3: Dependency Installation

Install all required Python packages using the provided requirements.txt file. This file contains pinned versions of all dependencies to ensure consistent behavior across different environments.

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The installation process may take several minutes as it downloads and compiles various packages, including machine learning libraries, web frameworks, and image processing tools. Monitor the installation output for any error messages or warnings that may indicate missing system dependencies.

If installation fails due to missing system libraries, install the required development packages:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install build-essential python3.11-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
sudo yum install python3-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel
```

### Step 4: Ollama Installation and Configuration

Install Ollama for local AI model deployment. Ollama provides a simple interface for running large language models locally, ensuring data privacy and reducing dependency on external services.

```bash
# Install Ollama (Linux/macOS)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve
```

For Windows environments, download the Ollama installer from the official website and follow the installation wizard. Once installed, start the Ollama service from the command line or system services.

Download and configure the recommended AI model:

```bash
# Pull the recommended model
ollama pull llama3.2-vision

# Verify model installation
ollama list
```

The model download may take considerable time depending on internet connection speed, as vision-capable models are typically several gigabytes in size. Ensure adequate disk space is available for model storage.

### Step 5: Configuration Setup

Create the environment configuration file by copying the provided template and customizing it for your specific deployment requirements.

```bash
# Copy environment template

    with Image.open(image_path) as img:
        # Resize large images to reduce memory usage
        if img.width > 2048 or img.height > 2048:
            img.thumbnail((2048, 2048), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
        
        # Convert to RGB if necessary
        if img.mode != 'RGB':
            img = img.convert('RGB')
        
        return img
```

**Caching Strategies:**

Implement caching for frequently accessed data and computed results:

```python
# Cache AI model responses for similar images
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def cached_ai_processing(image_hash):
    # Process image with AI model
    pass
```

### Database Optimization

If implementing database storage for processed invoice data, optimize database performance:

**Index Optimization:**

```sql
-- Create indexes for frequently queried columns
CREATE INDEX idx_invoice_date ON invoices(invoice_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_vendor_name ON invoices(vendor_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_processing_status ON processing_results(status);
```

**Query Optimization:**

Optimize database queries for efficient data retrieval and reporting operations.

**Connection Pooling:**

Implement database connection pooling to reduce connection overhead and improve performance.

## API Documentation

### Authentication

The current implementation focuses on internal enterprise use and does not include authentication mechanisms. For production deployments requiring authentication, consider implementing:

**API Key Authentication:**

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException, Depends
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer

security = HTTPBearer()

async def verify_api_key(token: str = Depends(security)):
    if token.credentials != "your-api-key":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid API key")
    return token
```

**OAuth 2.0 Integration:**

Integrate with existing OAuth 2.0 providers for enterprise single sign-on capabilities.

**JWT Token Authentication:**

Implement JWT tokens for stateless authentication and authorization.

### Endpoint Reference

**Health Check Endpoints:**

```
GET /
```
Returns basic health status and service information.

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "services": {
    "invoice_processor": "healthy",
    "file_monitor": "healthy",
    "ai_model": "healthy"
  }
}
```

**System Status:**

```
GET /status
```
Returns detailed system status including uptime, configuration, and performance metrics.

**Processing Statistics:**

```
GET /stats
```
Returns processing statistics and performance metrics.

Response:
```json
{
  "total_processed": 150,
  "successful": 142,
  "failed": 8,
  "pending": 3,
  "processing": 1,
  "average_processing_time": 2.5,
  "uptime": "2 days, 14:30:25"
}
```

**Manual Processing Trigger:**

```
POST /process
```
Triggers manual processing of files in the incoming folder.

Request Body:
```json
{
  "file_path": "optional/specific/file/path",
  "force_reprocess": false
}
```

**File Upload:**

```
POST /upload
```
Uploads an invoice file for processing.

Request: Multipart form data with file field.

**Processing Results:**

```
GET /results?limit=50
```
Returns recent processing results with optional limit parameter.

**Delete Processing Result:**

```
DELETE /results/{file_id}
```
Deletes a specific processing result by file ID.

### Error Handling

The API implements comprehensive error handling with structured error responses:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error description",
  "status_code": 400,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "error_type": "ValidationError"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 400: Bad Request (invalid input)
- 401: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- 404: Not Found (resource not found)
- 500: Internal Server Error (system error)
- 503: Service Unavailable (service not ready)

### Rate Limiting

For production deployments, implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation:

```python
from slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter
app.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)

@app.post("/upload")
@limiter.limit("10/minute")
async def upload_invoice(request: Request, file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # Implementation
    pass
```

This comprehensive deployment guide provides the foundation for successful implementation of the AI Invoice Processing Agent in various environments, from development to enterprise production deployments. Regular review and updates of these procedures ensure continued system reliability, security, and performance optimization.
